Memory allocation from stack and heap
    Arrays : We will use a dynamic array to put monsters and heroes in the heap. and every new
player attending this game will be added to the array.
    Strings : Things like players' name
    Object : Heroes, Monsters, and Boss;

User Input and Output
    Input : Command line, heroes' name, choose attack or choose quit.
    Output : reminder heroes' hp is not health, player win the game and play fail.

Object-oriented programming and Design
    Inheritance : when heroes defeat the monsters will inheritence weapones.
